# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 29, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Describe opportunities to modernize shonnadorsey.com. Used Bootstrap 3.x with support from codepens, templates (timeline starter (ico, html, css, js) to build existing site. Ideas to update: 
<ul>
  <li>Jumbotron - would like to modernize the slider</li>
  <li>timeline - would like to build it from scratch vs. a template and make it more interactive</li>
  <li>feeds: would like to add twitter and FB feeds to the site</li>
  <li>contact form: would like to build a secure contact form from scratch</li>
</ul>
